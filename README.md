This is probably a long shot and not realistic at all.

BUT, I want to see if I can move jobs over to being handled in the database. I personally cannot see a good reason why this is not currently handled in a database and pulled into a JSON temp memory object. THis would allow for easier administration without having to consistently reload things or wait for a server restart. I am a strong proponent for repetitive actions to be able to be handled without entire restarts.
